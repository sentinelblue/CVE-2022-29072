# CVE-2022-29072

>   7-Zip through 21.07 on Windows allows privilege escalation and command
>   execution when a file with the .7z extension is dragged to the
>   Help\>Contents area.

While the POC for privilege escalation at the GitHub repository below has not
been released (thankfully). We recommend you perform the current recommended
mitigation in place which is to remove the “7zip.chm” (compressed HTML help
file) from the installation directory in the meantime.

As well, utilize your SIEM to setup alerting of interactions between the
“7zip.chm” file with other utilities such as “cmd.exe”, “powershell.exe”, or
“pwsh.exe” to be alerted of any activity. We chose a more broad alert scheme as this is a rare occurance in our environment.

Refer to the Scripts and Sentinel directories for more information.
